### Howdy ðŸ¤ 
This is a collection of my projects and little problems Iâ€™ve solved in the past couple years.
Iâ€™ve not been great about holding onto my code until recently so this isnâ€™t a complete history by any means.
It does, however, show my most recent work and current capabilities fairly accurately though.
